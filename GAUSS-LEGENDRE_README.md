Hello, welcome to the section of the space on github dedicated to mathematics and engineering,

This is a quick guide for the Python script 'GaussQuad.py'.
First off, to get things started, you'll need a Python interpretor in order to run a script. There are currently many ways to do so, see https://realpython.com/run-python-scripts/ for a pretty comprehensive guide to set things up.
After which, simply call the function 'legendre()' in a terminal or a platform such as Anaconda and follow the steps. Have fun~
